## **Multiple Object Feature Fusion (MOFF) for weakly supervised deep learning**



High throughput automated blood film analysis under a brightfield microscope can be a rapid and unified solution to identify blood related disorders, especially in resource constrained settings.The major bottleneck in successfully analyzing blood films with deep learning vision techniquesis a lack of object-level annotations of disease markers such as parasites or abnormal red blood cells. This work proposes a deep learning supervised approach that leverages weak labels readily available from routine clinical microscopy to detect malaria and sickle cells in digital blood film microscopy. This approach is based on aggregating the convolutional features of multiple objects from multiple high resolution image fields.
